# Updating from v2 to v3

Release 3.0.0 raises the PHP requirement and reformats the codebase. **No public or protected
method signature changed**, so code written against 2.x keeps working on PHP 8.1.

## At a glance

| | v2 (2.0.x) | v3 (3.0.0) |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | `^7.2.5` | `^8.1.0` |
| Public API | — | unchanged |
| Coding style | Joomla Coding Standard | PSR-12 |

## Minimum supported PHP version raised

All Framework packages now require **PHP 8.1** or newer.

## No API changes

`Registry`, `Factory`, `FormatInterface` and the five format classes have the same signatures in
3.0.0 as in 2.0.0.

The magic property accessors and the per-call `$separator` arguments deprecated in 2.0 are still
present and still emit deprecation notices. They were removed in 4.0.0 — see
[Updating from v3 to v4](v3-to-v4-update.md). Fixing them while on 3.x makes that upgrade a no-op.

## Codebase converted to PSR-12

The package was reformatted from the Joomla Coding Standard to PSR-12. This touches nearly every
line and changes no behaviour.

## Dependency changes

| Package | v2 (2.0.x) | v3 (3.0.0) |
|---|---|---|
| `php` | `^7.2.5` | `^8.1.0` |
| `joomla/utilities` | `^2.0` | `^3.0` |
